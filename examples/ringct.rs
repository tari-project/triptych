//! In a RingCT design, outputs have (roughly speaking) two parts that we need:
//! - an output verification key, usually derived from a recipient address and nonce
//! - a value commitment, where the mask is derived from a shared secret
//!
//! A linkable ring signature is required in such a design.
//!
//! This example shows how to use Triptych.
